# REST Assured demo from Applitools university course
The code here was written while learning from this [course here](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/automating-your-api-tests-with-rest-assured/)
You can refer to the [course repo](https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-workshop)

I added my own touch here, you may find some slight modifications but makes some differences.

## Sample API
As a sample API, this API mentioned in the course is used

[Sample API](http://api.zippopotam.us/)

## Typicode fake API
[Typicode fake server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) is also used to demonstrate POST request

## How to run:
```sh
mvn test
```
or run a specific method:
```
mvn -Dtest TestClass#testMethod test
```

Good luck  :)
